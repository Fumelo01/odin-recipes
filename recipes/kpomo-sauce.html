    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash the kpomo/cowskin very well with salt-infused water to remove any sand, then transfer to a clean pot.</li>
      <li>Spice the kpomo/cowskin with salt, seasoning cube, sliced onions, and curry powder (optional). Cook until tender. Ensure the kpomo is cooked long enough to be soft.</li>
      <li>Remove the kpomo/cowskin from heat and drain the stock.</li>
      <li>Heat vegetable oil on medium heat until hot. Add chopped onions, garlic (optional), and ginger. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes until the onions are translucent or golden brown.</li>
      <li>Add curry powder and dried thyme, and continue frying. Add the pepper mixture and stir-fry to avoid burning. Fry on low-medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes until the oil separates from the pepper mixture or until all the liquid dries up. Add seasoning cubes, salt, and any other spices of your choice, and continue to fry.</li>
      <li>Add the kpomo/cowskin to the peppered sauce and stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes on low heat.</li>
      <li>Garnish the peppered kpomo with onion rings, sliced bell pepper, chopped peppers, or chopped spring onions, and fry for 1 minute (optional).</li>
      <li>Remove the peppered kpomo/cowskin from heat. Your mouthwatering peppered kpomo is ready to be served.</li>
