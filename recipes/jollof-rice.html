        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by precooking your meat with the listed spices (a teaspoon each of thyme, curry, and salt; two seasoning cubes and sliced onion) Allow the meat to cook till tender.</li>
            <li>Peel of the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound or grind.</li>
            <li>Parboil 4 cups of rice, wash, and set aside in a plastic bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is tender, separate from the stock and deep fry.</li>
            <li>Fry the ground tomatoes until it is turning day (about 20-25 minutes) stir continously to avoid burning it.</li>
            <li>When the tomato is well fried, add the chicken stock (meat water).</li>
            <li>Add the blended ginger/garlic, a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, two teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups of water also, taste, add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Add one seasoning cube. Stir and taste, you want it overly spiced. The rice will take some of it away.</li>
            <li>Allow to boil before adding the parboiled rice, stir.</li>
            <li>Then just cook with the pot covered till the rice is soft.</li>
            <li>Turn evenly and serve with the fried chicken.</li>
            <li>NOTE: If you don't want your jollof rice to start burning before it is well cooked, you need to remove some of the fried tomatoes before adding the rice. Then add it later.</li>
        </ol>
